# Titanic Survivor Analysis with Jupyter Notebook and GitHub Copilot
This project demonstrates the use of Jupyter Notebook and GitHub Copilot to analyze the Titanic survivor data.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to analyze the Titanic survivor data and draw meaningful insights from it. We will be using Jupyter Notebook as our primary tool for data analysis and visualization. GitHub Copilot will assist us in writing efficient and effective code.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic survivor data. It includes details like passenger age, sex, class, fare, survival status, etc. https://www.timestored.com/data/sample/titanic.parquet

### Tools Used
**Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

**GitHub Copilot**: Your AI pair programmer. With GitHub Copilot, get suggestions for whole lines or blocks of code as you type.

### Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook: pip install notebook
3. Navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
4. Open the .ipynb file and start exploring.

### Usage
Use the Jupyter Notebook to run the cells and analyze the Titanic survivor data. GitHub Copilot will assist you in writing the code.
